# Garbage Classification

A machine learning project for classifying garbage images into different categories using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Overview

This repository contains code and notebooks for developing a garbage classification model. The goal is to accurately distinguish between various types of waste such as recyclables, organic, and other categories, aiding in efficient waste management.

## Features

- Image classification using machine learning techniques
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Model training and evaluation in Jupyter Notebooks
- Visualization of results and metrics

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Recommended: Anaconda for package management

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SudoAnirudh/Garbage-Classification.git
    cd Garbage-Classification
    ```
2. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    or set up the environment with Anaconda:
    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate garbage-classification
    ```

### Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. Open the main notebook file (e.g., `Garbage_Classification.ipynb`) and follow the steps for data loading, preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

- Ensure you have the dataset available in the appropriate directory as expected by the notebook.
- Dataset sources and preparation instructions (if any) should be added here.

## Results

- Include a summary of your results, sample outputs, or screenshots.
